## 📌 Project Overview  
Agriculture is the backbone of Kenya’s economy, yet farmers and traders struggle with market access, price volatility, and supply-chain inefficiencies. **AgriSenseAI** leverages deep learning and data analytics to offer **real-time market recommendations and price forecasts** for maize, tomatoes, and avocados.  

This system integrates:  
✅ **Historical price data**  
✅ **Weather conditions & NDVI (Vegetation Health Index)**  
✅ **Supply-demand trends**  
✅ **Transport costs & road quality**  
✅ **Macroeconomic indicators (Inflation, Exchange rates, Fuel costs)**  

Our goal is to **empower farmers and traders** with data-driven insights for better market decisions.
