    "For price prediction, the process began with a carefully prepared dataset enriched with temporal features, lag variables, rolling statistics, and market-specific indicators, which formed the basis for developing two deep learning models—one for wholesale prices and one for retail prices. The model architectures were optimized using an automated hyperparameter tuning process, specifically the Hyperband algorithm from the Keras Tuner library. This approach defined a search space that included the number of units in dense layers, dropout usage and rates (ranging from 0.1 to 0.5), the option to add extra layers, and learning rates sampled logarithmically between 1e-4 and 1e-2. Hyperband dynamically allocated training resources by evaluating models based on the validation mean absolute error (val_mae), allowing promising configurations to train for more epochs while quickly terminating those with poor performance. The data was split into training and test sets to ensure robust evaluation."

The process begins with a separate, cleaned, and encoded dataset that is balanced using synthetic oversampling to ensure fair representation across different market classes, followed by dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) after standard scaling. The deep learning classifier is then constructed with multiple dense layers, enhanced by techniques such as batch normalization and dropout, and outputs probabilities across market classes via a softmax layer. The model is trained with early stopping and evaluated using classification accuracy as well as detailed precision, recall, and f1-scores for each market class. "

    "We developed a user-friendly interface by combining FastAPI and Streamlit. FastAPI handled the backend logic, providing APIs for price predictions and market recommendations by processing user inputs and fetching data from the saved prediction csv  files. Streamlit was used to create an intuitive frontend where users could interact with the application, selecting crops, counties, and price types to receive predictions and market suggestions. We deployed the app on Streamlit Community Cloud by linking the project from GitHub, enabling easy access for farmers through a public URL. This approach allowed us to seamlessly integrate backend calculations with a simple, interactive UI for farmers.\n",
